        <br /><br />
        Hi, I’m <span className="text-zinc-200">Isares Khamwirai</span>.
        <br /><br />
        I have a background in healthcare service, with experience in
        coordination and communication across teams.
        <br /><br />
        I’m currently transitioning into tech, focusing on building
        practical, real-world web projects.
        <br /><br />
        I enjoy learning through hands-on development and continuously
        improving my skills by working on real projects.
